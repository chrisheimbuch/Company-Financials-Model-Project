## Usage
Explore the code to see how Python can enhance your reporting processes.

The research file goes through extensive testing and methods to clean the data. The main file is an executable with the push of a button will clean the data and generate the excel reports and visuals in seconds which can be repeatable for the same type of report, save time, and reduce human error.
